### Objectives

On average, a round session should last around 5 minutes.

Players compete in an arena for control of the flying banana. The player that controls the banana continually receives points. In order to get the banana off another player you simply have to knock him/her off balance: Run into other players at full speed, knock them into reactive obstacles, or send them flying off the platform with a well placed kick.

Throughout the game players must be aware of the bananaâ€™s position as well as hostile fighters. Position yourself in a spot that gives you an advantage over your target and avoid opening yourself up to other attacks.

Finally, obstacles are placed throughout an environment that you can use to your advantage: Bouncy surfaces, volatile surfaces, stick surfaces and destructible surfaces provide endless ways to dominate the arena.
Scoring
The player that currently holds the banana receives 6 points per second. Point cap is set at 1000 points.
